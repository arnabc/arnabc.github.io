    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have had my fair share of developing &ldquo;Kiosk Mode&rdquo; or &ldquo;Single Application Mode&rdquo; applications for Android. The idea is to run only one custom app and prevent any other applications to run (or only whitelisted applications). In this blog post I would like to share the approaches that you can take and the possible challenges you&rsquo;ll face while developing these type of applications. This is a high-level overview of the effort involved, and not meant to provide code examples which will be beyond the scope of the post.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>General requirements for such applications</h2>

<ul>
<li>Only one app is allowed to run.</li>
<li>Only whitelisted contacts are allowed to be contacted (via Phone or SMS)</li>
<li>Only whitelisted apps are allowed to be used.</li>
<li>Tracking which applications are installed or uninstalled.</li>
<li>Disable status bar.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Things to consider before developing the app</h2>

<ul>
<li>Developing for the masses? Will it be distributed through the Play store ? Not a good use case for Kiosk mode applications IMHO don&rsquo;t do it, users don&rsquo;t like it when you take over their phone and don&rsquo;t allow them to use the phone freely. Might work for a very specific niche for example a mounted Tablet in a restaurant which displays today&rsquo;s menus and recipes.</li>
<li>If you are developing it for controlled distribution, not through the Play store, then finalize the type of devices which will be used to distribute your app. Most common scenario is that it will be a cheap Chinese tablet running either Android 4.0+. Get familiar with the device first, figure out how many hardware keys are there and which ones you need to block or modify.</li>
<li>Savvy users can bypass your restrictions if the devices are not physically secured. Although nothing in this world is completely secure so always watch out for surprises.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>My focus on this post will be controlled distribution where you as a developer have physical control over the devices.</strong></p>

<h2>Approaches for developing Kiosk Mode applications</h2>

<p>Following are the two approaches that you can take depending on your expertise and skill.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developing as a Launcher application</li>
<li>Building a custom ROM</li>
</ul>


<h2>Developing as a Launcher Application</h2>

<p>This approach is the easiest one that you can take, developing a Launcher application is fairly simple and you can quickly get going without much of a trouble. Let me roughly list out the items which you need to do:</p>

<h4>Only your app is allowed to run always</h4>

<p>As mentioned above make it a Launcher app and ensure that it is the default launcher app, after installation you can disable the old launcher app using <code>pm disable &lt;PACKAGE_OR_COMPONENT&gt;</code> command. Now as your launcher app is the default one so it will be started automatically on boot, nothing fancy here.</p>

<h4>Detect when new applications are opened</h4>

<p>In order to enforce control, you may need to detect when a new application is opened to figure out whether it is an allowed application or not. There are two ways that you can go about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a repeated alarm, for example every 5 seconds and retrieve the topmost activity from the currently running applications and and see if that package is allowed to run if not then bring your home screen in the foreground and use <code>ActivityManager.killBackgroundProcess()</code> to kill that app (will not work for system apps though). There are caveats to this approach, it is heavy on resources and drains battery very quickly.</li>
<li>Use <strong>AccessibilityService</strong> and it lets you know when a new application window is opened and then you can check which application is currently running and act accordingly. This is on demand and is not heavy on resources. The caveat is that you have to manually enable the service from <code>Settings --&gt; Accessibility</code>. Assuming physical control over the devices, so this should not be an issue, but it&rsquo;s manual and that&rsquo;s the downside.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Detect if new applications are installed or uninstalled</h4>

<p>Android provides broadcast receivers for you to track when a new application is installed or uninstalled. Use them and log the activities accordingly.</p>

<h4>Disable status bar</h4>

<p>You cannot override the status bar,  so the only option is to run a background service and create a opaque overlay view and position it on top of the status bar, this status bar should consume all touch events (this is how custom status bar replacements apps work I think), you&rsquo;ll need <code>android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW</code> permission to put your view on top of all other windows. Also you can make your Launcher app fullscreen as well.</p>

<h4>Make your app a Device Administrator</h4>

<p>Take advantage of Device Administrator features, this will provide some elevated access rights to perform administrative tasks, like remotely lock screen, wipe out the data etc.</p>

<h4>Automatic Update</h4>

<p>If you need automatic update support but don&rsquo;t want to distribute your app through Play Store, then you need to &ldquo;<strong>root</strong>&rdquo; the device and run a separate app which will update your app when there is a new version. This requires you to build a backend as well. I wrote a blog post on this topic some time ago, <a href="http://arnab.ch/blog/2012/01/android-auto-updating-homescreen-application/">Android auto-updating homescreen application</a>.</p>

<h2>Building a custom ROM</h2>

<p>This is by far the most preferable and a reliable approach. You can create your custom build right out of AOSP source code, but based on your device you will need some proprietary files. Take a look at the AOKP/CynogenMod for custom ROMS for your device.</p>

<p>Building custom ROM is bit difficult as it will take you some time to fully grok the process but once you&rsquo;re through with this, then it will be alright. I suggest you try building a custom ROM from vanilla AOSP source and test it in Emulator using Virtual Device. It will also be a very good learning exercise for you.</p>

<p>You need to build your own backend infrastructure for distribution and remote management.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Developing kiosk based applications are difficult but not impossible, the problem begins when you start to control the device&rsquo;s default functions, if you see that you need to completely lock-down a device then it is wiser that you go down the custom ROM path instead of trying to make it work in consumer grade Android phones.</p>

    <link href="http://arnab.ch/blog/2013/08/asynchronous-http-requests-in-android-using-volley/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-21T22:24:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2013/08/asynchronous-http-requests-in-android-using-volley</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volley is the new Swiss Army Knife of Android Developers, it provides some nice utilities which makes the networking for Android apps easier and faster. The good thing about Volley is that it abstracts away the low level details of what HTTP client library is being used under the hood and helps you focus on writing nice and clean RESTful HTTP requests. Additionally all requests in Volley are executed asynchronously on a different thread without blocking your &ldquo;main thread&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What are the features that Volley provides?</h2>

<p>Important features of the Volley library:</p>

<ul>
<li>A high level API to make asynchronous RESTful HTTP requests</li>
<li>An elegant and robust Request queue</li>
<li>An extensible architecture which allows developers to implement custom request and response handling mechanism</li>
<li>Ability to use external HTTP client library</li>
<li>Robust request caching policy</li>
<li>Custom views to load and cache images from Network (<code>NetworkImageView</code>, <code>ImageLoader</code> etc)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why use asynchronous HTTP requests?</h2>

<p>In Android it is always a good practice to make HTTP requests asynchronously, in fact from HoneyComb onwards it is no longer just a &ldquo;good practice&rdquo;, you must make HTTP requests asynchronously off the main thread or else you&rsquo;ll get this nasty exception <code>android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException</code>. Blocking the main thread has some serious consequences, it hampers UI rendering, harmful to smooth user experience and above all it can cause dreaded ANR (Application Not Responding). To avoid all these pitfalls you as a developer should always ensure that your HTTP requests are on a different thread.</p>

<h2>How to use Volley</h2>

<p>We are going to cover the following items in this blog post, by the end of it you should be able to have a clear understanding of Volley and how to use it in your application.</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing and using Volley as a library project</li>
<li>Using Request Queue</li>
<li>Making asynchronous JSON and String HTTP requests</li>
<li>Cancelling requests</li>
<li>Retrying failed requests, customizing request Timeout</li>
<li>Setting Request Headers (HTTP headers)</li>
<li>Using cookies</li>
<li>Error Handling</li>
</ul>


<h3>Installing and using Volley as a library project</h3>

<p>Volley is part of AOSP and right now it is not being distributed as a JAR, the easiest way to include Volley to your project is to clone the Volley repository and set it as a library project.</p>

<h4>Using as a library project</h4>

<p>Git clone the repository using the following command and then import it as Android library project:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Using as a JAR</h4>

<p>Clone the repository as shown above and then run the following commands to export it as JAR and after that add the JAR file to your project&rsquo;s <code>/libs</code> folder:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># in Volley project root (ensure the `android` executable is in your path)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>android update project -p .
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># the following command will create a JAR file and put it in ./bin</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ant jar
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Using Request Queue</h3>

<p>All requests in Volley are placed in a queue first and then processed, here is how you will be creating a request queue:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>RequestQueue </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">RequestQueue</span> <span class="n">mRequestQueue</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Volley</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">newRequestQueue</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// &#39;this&#39; is Context</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ideally you should have one centralized place for your Queue, and the best place to initialize queue is in your <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html">Application</a> class. Here is how this can be done:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>ApplicationController.java </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<h3>Making asynchronous HTTP requests</h3>

<p>Volley provides the following utility classes which you can use to make asynchronous HTTP requests:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/CRMvRj">JsonObjectRequest</a> &mdash; To send and receive JSON Object from the Server</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/F02Ew3">JsonArrayRequest</a> &mdash; To receive JSON Array from the Server</li>
<li><a href="http://goo.gl/c5DB8p">StringRequest</a> &mdash; To retrieve response body as String (ideally if you intend to parse the response by yourself)</li>
</ul>


<p><em>Note:</em> To send parameters in request body you need to override either <code>getParams()</code> or <code>getBody()</code> method of the request classes (as required) described below.</p>

<h4>JsonObjectRequest</h4>

<p>This class can be used to send and receive JSON object. An overloaded constructor of this class allows to set appropriate request method (DELETE, GET, POST and PUT). This is the class which you should be using frequently if you are working with a RESTful backend. The following examples show how to make GET and POST requests.</p>

<p>Using HTTP GET method:</p>

<h4>JsonArrayRequest</h4>

<p>This class can be used to retrieve <strong>JSON array</strong> but not <strong>JSON object</strong> and only HTTP GET is supported as of now. As it supports only GET, so if you are to specify some querystring parameters then append those in the URL itself. The constructor does not accept request parameters.</p>

<h4>StringRequest</h4>

<p>Setting a priority to the request is possible, this may be desirable in some cases where you want to move certain requests higher up in the order. The requests are processed from higher priorities to lower priorities, in FIFO order. To set a priority you need to override the <code>getPriority()</code> method of the request class. The current available priorities are &ndash; <code>Priority.LOW</code>, <code>Priority.NORMAL</code>, <code>Priority.HIGH</code> and <code>Priority.IMMEDIATE</code>.</p>

<h3>Cancelling requests</h3>

<p>Volley provides powerful APIs to cancel pending or ongoing requests, one reason when you need to do this is if user rotates his device while a request is ongoing you need to cancel that because the Activity is going be restarted. The easiest way to cancel a request is to call the <code>cancelAll(tag)</code> method of the request queue, this will only work if you have set a <strong>tag on the request object</strong> before adding it to the queue. The ability to tag requests allows you to cancel all pending requests for that tag in one method call.</p>

<p>Adding a request to the queue using a tag:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setTag</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;My Tag&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As per the ApplicationController class shown above, this is how you&rsquo;ll add the request to the queue:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">ApplicationController</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInstance</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">addToRequestQueue</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;My Tag&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Cancelling all requests with the specified tag:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">mRequestQueue</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">cancelAll</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;My Tag&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As per the ApplicationController class shown above, this is how you&rsquo;ll cancel the requests:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">ApplicationController</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInstance</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">addToRequestQueue</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">&quot;My Tag&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Retrying failed requests and customizing request Timeout</h3>

<p>There is no direct way to specify request timeout value in Volley, but there is a workaround, you need to set a RetryPolicy on the request object. The <code>DefaultRetryPolicy</code> class takes an argument called <em>initialTimeout</em>, this can be used to specify a request timeout, make sure the maximum retry count is 1 so that volley does not retry the request after the timeout has been exceeded.</p>

<p>If you want to retry failed requests (due to timeout) you can specify that too using the code above, just increase the retry count. Note the last argument, it allows you to specify a backoff multiplier which can be used to implement &ldquo;exponential backoff&rdquo; that some RESTful services recommends.</p>

<h3>Setting Request Headers (HTTP headers)</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to add extra headers to the HTTP requests, one common case is to add an &ldquo;Authorization&rdquo; header for HTTP Basic Auth. Volley Request class provides a method called <code>getHeaders()</code> which you need to override to add your custom headers if necessary.</p>

<p>Adding custom headers:</p>

<h3>Using cookies</h3>

<p>There is no direct API through which you can set cookies in Volley. This makes sense because the core philosophy of Volley is to provide clean APIs to write RESTful HTTP requests, these days most of the  RESTful API providers prefer authentication tokens instead of cookies. Using cookies in Volley is a bit more involed process and not very straight forward.</p>

<p>Here is a modified version of the <code>getRequestQueue()</code> method of our ApplicationController class shown above, also contains the rough code required to set a cookie:</p>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<p>As you have seen in the above code examples when you create a request object in Volley you need to specify  an error listener, Volley invokes the <code>onErrorResponse</code> callback method of that listener passing an instance of the <code>VolleyError</code> object when there is an error while performing the request.</p>

<p>The following is the list of exceptions in Volley:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AuthFailureError</strong> &mdash; If you are trying to do Http Basic authentication then this error is most likely to come.</li>
<li><strong>NetworkError</strong> &mdash; Socket disconnection, server down, DNS issues might result in this error.</li>
<li><strong>NoConnectionError</strong> &mdash; Similar to NetworkError, but fires when device does not have internet connection, your error handling logic can club <code>NetworkError</code> and <code>NoConnectionError</code> together and treat them similarly.</li>
<li><strong>ParseError</strong> &mdash; While using <code>JsonObjectRequest</code> or <code>JsonArrayRequest</code> if the received JSON is malformed then this exception will be generated. If you get this error then it is a problem that should be fixed instead of being handled.</li>
<li><strong>ServerError</strong> &mdash; The server responded with an error, most likely with <em>4xx</em> or <em>5xx</em> HTTP status codes.</li>
<li><strong>TimeoutError</strong> &mdash; Socket timeout, either server is too busy to handle the request or there is some network latency issue. By default Volley times out the request after <strong>2.5 seconds</strong>, use a RetryPolicy if you are consistently getting this error.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can use a simple helper like the following to display appropriate message when one of these exceptions occurs:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Volley is really a nice library and you should seriously consider giving this a try. It will help you simplify your network requests and also add a ton of additional benefits.</p>

<p>I understand that it&rsquo;s a tl;dr post, actually I tried to be as comprehensive as possible, I am planning to come up with another post about image loading using Volley and some gotchas that I noticed while using the library in one of my projects, till then stay tuned.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this :&ndash;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Android the screen that appears when the phone starts is called &ldquo;Launcher Screen&rdquo;. It is possible in Android to write custom launcher apps which can be used as a replacement for the default launcher app that comes bundled with the phone. Developing a launcher app is no different than developing any other Android application, in fact both are same. In this post I&rsquo;ll share what you need to do to write your own custom launcher application.</p>

<p>The important line in the above <em>XML</em> file is <code>&lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.HOME" /&gt;</code>, this <code>intent-filter</code> allows you to set your application as <strong>Home Screen</strong> application. Android looks for this particular intent filter and whenever you install your app with this intent-filter set then your application will appear in the list of installed launchers (a tap on the Home button will reveal the list).</p>

<h2>Display installed applications in our custom homescreen</h2>

<p>Now as we have finished with the manifest file, let&rsquo;s add some code to display the list of installed applications in our Home Screen, this way we can at least use the app after installing.</p>

<h3>AsyncTaskLoader to asynchronously load applications</h3>

<p>Here is the code to load the applications list asynchronously, we&rsquo;re using a custom AsyncTaskLoader class, later we&rsquo;ll hook it up in our fragment class using the Android Loaders.</p>

<h2>Running the homescreen application</h2>

<p>As it&rsquo;s a Launcher app, so when you install it you don&rsquo;t get to see anything unless you tap on the home button. The tap on the Home button  shows you a chooser dialog from which you can select the appropriate Launcher app.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, you now have your own custom launcher application. Although a full-fledged launcher app like the ones that come with Android phones has many features built into them, but you can use this as a basic building block and start writing a more advanced and complex launcher as you learn.</p>

<p>For those who wants to investigate further, do take a look at the default launcher application code here: <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Launcher2/+/master/">Android Stock Launcher App</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I wrote another post which provides a high-level overview of what all things are required to develop a &ldquo;<strong>kiosk-mode</strong>&rdquo; Android application. You can check it out here &ndash; <a href="http://arnab.ch/blog/2013/11/developing-kiosk-mode-applications-in-android/">Developing kiosk-mode applications in Android</a></p>

    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2012/09/android-how-to-send-gzipped-json-in-http-request</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have ever developed an Android application which sends and consumes large amount of JSON data without gzipping then this post is probably for you. This is a very simple optimization technique that you can implement which vastly reduces the network latency and also benefits the users as well as internet. The idea is to transfer less data over the network and once you do that, it improves the speed of your application and helps users by reducing their mobile data usage (i.e saves $$$ in fact).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/http/AndroidHttpClient.html"><code>AndroidHttpClient</code></a> module offers a way to achieve this, when you&rsquo;re sending JSON requests you can gzip the content of the request params and add some necessary HTTP headers, which will provide a hint to your server that it has to decode the content before it is usable. Needless to say that this technique is not just limited to sending JSON, you can of course use it if you&rsquo;re sending CSV or text file over the network to server.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll show a way how this can be done using a Rails backend (that&rsquo;s what I use), but I presume this should not be too difficult to implement in case you&rsquo;re not using Rails. I&rsquo;ll be using JSON as an example here:</p>

<p>To encode or decode the JSON content you can use the following utility module in Android:</p>

<p>The HTTP header, which indicates to server that the request content is gzipped, is <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code>. On the Rails side you can use the following <strong>Rack</strong> middleware to decode JSON requests (you can set your webserver for example nginx to do the encoding on JSON responses):</p>

<p>A Rack middleware to decode the gzipped JSON, thanks to this <a href="https://gist.github.com/2109707">gist</a> by <a href="https://gist.github.com/relistan">relistan</a>:</p>

<p>Now put this in somewhere in your Rails web application directory for example <code>lib/middleware</code>, just make sure that the file is loaded when Rails boots. To include the file in Rails&#8217; <strong>autoload</strong> path, add it like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">autoload_paths</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="sx">%W(</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sx">/lib </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sx">/lib/middleware)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once that is done, then you need to add this tiny little Rack app as a middleware, and the important trick is to add it before the <code>ActionDispatch::ParamsParser</code> middleware in Rails 3:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1"># Handle Compressed Requests, this middleware makes gzip content </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># handling transparent to the Rails stack</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">middleware</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">insert_before</span> <span class="ss">ActionDispatch</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:ParamsParser</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;CompressedRequests&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&rsquo;s all you need both on client and server to send and receive Gzipped content. If you&rsquo;re sending JSON from client and you wan&rsquo;t rails to interpret it as JSON, then don&rsquo;t forget to add <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> on your HTTP Request header.</p>

    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2012/09/danger-of-using-same-password-everywhere</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been said many times before by a lot of great people from the world of Computer Security and I am going to say it again, yes again, even though you don&rsquo;t like it!</p>

<blockquote><p><big>Do not use same password everywhere</big></p></blockquote>

<p>Why not? No one can guess my password, it&rsquo;s ultra-strong, it contains letters, digits and even some special characters, I have even tested it with <a href="http://www.passwordmeter.com/">Password Strength Meter</a>, so it&rsquo;s simply unbreakable :&ndash;).</p>

<p>Indeed your password is unbreakable and even unguessable but there is a very good chance that you&rsquo;ll lay it bare without even knowing it. Surprised right? Want to know how is this possible? Keep reading, I am going to tell you about the possibilities.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>These days we spend a considerable amount of time on the Internet looking for useful stuff that we would like to use. Most of these websites require signing up to the service in order to use it, during that process it also asks you to create an &ldquo;username/password&rdquo; and also your email id so that they can communicate with you. The problem lies right there in the process when you create an &ldquo;username&rdquo; and &ldquo;password&rdquo;. If you are a person who mostly uses same password everywhere, then you are at risk without even realizing it.</p>

<p>So what is the risk? The risk is, you don&rsquo;t know whether the site that you are signing up is actually <strong>storing your password in plain text</strong> or not. Logically, the website should <strong>encrypt</strong> your password before storing it in the database, but not all websites do that. There aren&rsquo;t many ways that you can discover whether they are storing it in plain text or in encrypted form. But, there is a way and that is if you receive a confirmation email from that site where they have mentioned your username and password then it clearly is an indication that they are storing it in <strong>plain text</strong> &ndash; remember one thing <strong>a one-way encrypted password cannot be converted back to plain text</strong> (theoretically and the cost of decrypting is much higher), so it is technically impossible for that website to send you your password in plain text form. The other option is to try out the &ldquo;Forget Password&rdquo; facility and see if they are sending you your old password in plain text to retrieve your account.</p>

<p>You may ask why storing password in plain text is wrong ? It is wrong because <strong>nothing in this world is completely secure</strong>. If that site is ever compromised and the attacker gets hold of the database then he will have a list of users with their usernames, emails and passwords ( in plain text ), the damage is not limited to that website only, it is much bigger than you can even think of. Let&rsquo;s imagine that you are an attacker and you have successfully compromised &ldquo;example.com&rdquo; which stores the user detail (password) in plain text, now you have a list of users with their email ids and the passwords that they have used while signing up to &ldquo;example.com&rdquo;, now if you try to log in to the users&#8217; email accounts using the password you have on that list for each email ids, you&rsquo;ll see that at least 20-30% of users or even more have the same password. See the pattern? There is a Domino effect once you lose access to your email account, you&rsquo;ll lose access to your Facebook, Twitter and probably other services for example Bank accounts.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things that you can follow to minimize the damage as much as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be an idiot, the safety of your valuable data should be extremely important to you. It is not necessary to jump right into the fray the moment you receive an invite email from your friend about a cool new site. If you really want to try out the site then create a fake account first ( you can create fake email ids at <a href="http://www.mailinator.com">Mailinator</a> ).</li>
<li>Use separate password for each of your important email/social network accounts. There are some password generators that you can use e.g. <strong>1Password</strong></li>
<li>See if that site is offering other ways of authentication without sharing/giving your email id or password, for example OpenID and OAuth. Nowadays Facebook, Twitter, Google and Yahoo all provide OAuth/OpenID authentication service for third-party websites.</li>
<li>Search in your inbox to see if you have received any email earlier from a website where they had sent you your username and password in plain text, if you find one then try deleting that account if not possible then see whether the password matches with any of your email ids, if it does then change your password immediately.</li>
</ul>


<p>I know even all the steps mentioned above are not 100% foolproof, but at least if you are aware of the fact then it will surely help you minimize the risk. This is more like a &ldquo;Social Engineering&rdquo; problem, if you can understand this then take necessary steps to prevent it as much as possible.</p>

<h2>For websites developers</h2>

<p>The safety and security of users&#8217; data is extremely important, it is always a good practice ( rather a must-have practice ) to encrypt sensitive user data. Storing passwords in plain text is utterly irresponsible and disrespectful act to the users. Also make sure that passwords are filtered out from your server&rsquo;s log files. A little bit common sense can help protect the Internet as well as users.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-21T00:26:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2012/01/android-auto-updating-homescreen-application</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, the title of the post may not be descriptive enough of the complexity that we dealt with in one of our recent projects. Before I delve deeper into the actual problem, let me give you some background of what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve. We&rsquo;ve been working on an Android application for some time which is going to be installed in kiosks or in cabs mainly on Android tablets (currently Android 2.2 devices), basically this is a sort of in-cab entertainment system where you can listen to music, watch videos, latest movie trailers and promos, read latest news, search places and find them in maps. You may think what&rsquo;s so complicated about it? Well this app is an Android Homescreen application and this is going to be the only application that users can access from the tablets and above all it&rsquo;ll be <strong>remotely managed</strong>.</p>

<p>The term <strong>remotely managed</strong> means that the app will be automatically updated over the air, there will be a provisioning server where the admins can publish/upload a new build, and that build will automatically be installed in the devices. Other than that the device can also be remotely restarted or shut down. The content that users can access or play using the app is stored in the device for faster access, and that content is synced (i.e. updated) periodically from a remote content syncing server. All of these are happening over the internet and the devices are equipped with a 3G chip, which makes it easier to download large amount of data with a decent network speed, else the content syncing would be a real pain. Below is the list of rough requirements that we had:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main app will be the only app which users can access.</li>
<li>Automatic update over the air using a provisioning server.</li>
<li>Sync content from a remote content syncing server.</li>
<li>Report Crashes and device health statuses to the server.</li>
</ul>


<!--more-->


<p>If you look at the requirements above, this ain&rsquo;t an easy task and sure it&rsquo;s not, we&rsquo;re developing the app since last few months and are close to completion, the app is currently being field tested and hopefully it&rsquo;ll soon be live out there in the wild.</p>

<p>So the big question is what are the challenges that we faced while we pulled off this effort, the purpose of this blog post is to share some of the findings/knowledge that we&rsquo;ve gained over the period of time while developing the app. The ways that we&rsquo;ve adopted are not the ones which can be adopted if you&rsquo;re going to have your app be distributed through the Android market, our app isn&rsquo;t or will not be distributed from the Android market, this is a custom application developed for a very specific/limited set of devices in mind. I&rsquo;ll cover each of the requirements mentioned above and will share some of the rough design choices that we made in order to meet the requirements.</p>

<h2>The main app will be the only app which users can access</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one way that you can have this kind of application in Android, make your app a homescreen app, so that whenever users press home/back button they&rsquo;ll land up right there in your app, and they can&rsquo;t get out of it (provided your app is the default one). In order to prevent users from exiting your app, you may need to handle some other stuff like options menu, disable recent items, and may be some extra buttons (some Chinese devices come with extra buttons on 7&Prime; Android tablets) etc. These extra keys can be handled/prevented using Android key handling code.</p>

<h2>Automatic update over the air using a provisioning server</h2>

<p>This is an interesting part, you may be aware of that in Android the automatic update of an app can only happen through Marketplace, there&rsquo;s no other way to update an app. But our app is not going to be distributed through Marketplace, so how do we update then? Well there&rsquo;s no easy way to do it, and the process is complicated.</p>

<p>First of all, in Android in order to <em>silently install</em> an app, you need special permission called INSTALL_PACKAGES which is a <em>system permission</em> and IS NOT available to apps <em>not signed</em> with system/firmware certificate. This is an issue that we need to get past in order to make it happen, after few days of searching and testing several options, I narrowed it down to the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sign the app with the system certificate</strong> &ndash; This was not possible because we couldn&rsquo;t procure the certificate from the hardware vendor of our choice.</li>
<li><strong>Install our own Android custom ROM with the app bundled</strong> &ndash; This was possible, but it requires more engineering effort as well as taking care of device drivers that manufacturers ship with the device. Other than that there&rsquo;s a maintenance effort involved in future where we have to ensure that our custom Android ROM works with at least two to three different devices. So, this too was not a viable solution for us.</li>
<li><strong>Root the device and install the package through code</strong> &ndash; This was the last option that I tried and IT WORKED!, after couple of iterations on rooting procedure, I managed to root the device properly.</li>
</ol>


<p>At first I tried the <strong>rageagainstthecage</strong> exploit to root, but it were only able to temporarily root the device and it wouldn&rsquo;t survive a reboot. Then I used <strong>psneuter</strong> to root the device and installed <strong>busybox</strong> and the modified <strong>su</strong> binary provided by the excellent guys from <a href="http://shortfuse.org/"><strong>SuperOneClick</strong></a> installer. Along with that I also installed the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.noshufou.android.su&amp;hl=en">Superuser</a> app to manage the <em>su</em> permissions. Once the rooting procedure is in place it&rsquo;s time to move on to code and write an Android service which can automatically install our application.</p>

<h3>Updater Service</h3>

<p>This service is the crux of this application, it acts as a &ldquo;remote control&rdquo; to manage the device as well as our homescreen application. We decided to build it as a separate app not part of the homescreen application, because this app is not going to have any GUI. So how does this work? Below is the rough diagram of it&rsquo;s architecture:</p>

<p><img src="http://arnab.ch/images/updater-service-sequence-diagram.png" alt="Updater Service Sequence Diagram" /></p>

<p>In the above diagram, our Updater app is started whenever the device is rebooted (as per our installation process, we reboot the device after installing the update service app), it sets up a repeating alarm using a <em>PendingIntent</em>, which is invoked after a certain period of time, in the mean time it also makes a quick request to the provisioning server for any available update. If there&rsquo;s an update then the UpdateService downloads the APK (link provided in the update check response) and once it&rsquo;s downloaded (stored in the SDcard) it then fires up an intent to start the PackageInstaller and gives the APK file path as part of the intent payload. The PackageInstaller then runs the <code>pm install -r &lt;apkPath&gt;</code> command with <code>su</code> privilege. In order to execute the commands as <em>root</em> I used a modified version of the <a href="http://muzikant-android.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-get-root-access-and-execute.html">excellent piece of code available from here</a>. Once the installation process is complete we notify the backend server that the device has been updated with the latest app (by the way it may already be clear to you that the provisioning server has the list of devices running in the wild and knows which device is running what version of the app). Anyway, this cycle of checking for updates continues as every time the alarm fires or the device is rebooted.</p>

<p>Although the entire procedure went smoothly, it wasn&rsquo;t without a hitch, as I mentioned that our app is a homescreen application and in Android when you have multiple homescreen apps, every time you click on the home button you&rsquo;re presented with a list of homescreen apps to choose from. So in our case we have two homescreen apps one is the default Android <strong>Launcher</strong> and the other is our homescreen app, as part of the installation procedure we set that app up to be the default one. But after update that settings was getting reset and pressing on the home button again was displaying that list of homescreen apps to choose from. We tried to solve this through code by setting our own <code>Activity</code> as the default homescreen app using the Android API <code>addPreferredActivty()</code> but that didn&rsquo;t work because it has been removed/disabled by Google from Android 2.2 Froyo onwards (it was available till 2.1), the device that we&rsquo;re using has the Android version 2.2.2. This was almost a dead end and that time we came up with a <strong>very interesting</strong> hack, and the trick is very simple <strong>just rename the launcher APK</strong>, ya that&rsquo;s it just rename it and it&rsquo;s gone :&ndash;). So here&rsquo;s the steps that we have:</p>

<h4>Before Install Steps</h4>

<ol>
<li>Mount the <code>/system</code> folder as RW volume using <code>busybox</code>, by default it&rsquo;s readonly.</li>
<li>Restore(rename) the original lancher apk back to &ldquo;Launcher.apk&rdquo;</li>
<li>Unmount the <code>/system</code> back to it&rsquo;s original ReadOnly mode.</li>
</ol>


<p>Example commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example commands </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>busybox mount -o rw,remount /system
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv /system/app/Launcher.tmp.apk /system/app/Launcher.apk
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>busybox mount -o ro,remount /system
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>After Install Steps</h4>

<ol>
<li>Mount the <code>/system</code> folder as RW volume using <code>busybox</code>, by default it&rsquo;s readonly.</li>
<li>Rename the original &ldquo;Launcher.apk&rdquo; to &ldquo;Launcher.tmp.apk&rdquo;</li>
<li>Unmount the <code>/system</code> back to it&rsquo;s original ReadOnly mode.</li>
</ol>


<p>Example commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Example commands </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>busybox mount -o rw,remount /system
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mv /system/app/Launcher.apk /system/app/Launcher.tmp.apk
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>busybox mount -o ro,remount /system
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note: In some devices the Launcher apk may be named as Launcher2.apk.</p>

<h2>Sync content from a remote content syncing server</h2>

<p>Similarly to the update service above, the Content Syncing part is also a separate app without a GUI, it gets started on RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED intent and checks for updated content once a day. We download a pretty large amount of data which can range anywhere from 100MB-1GB. Below is the sequence diagram of the rough architecture that we have:</p>

<p><img src="http://arnab.ch/images/content-sync-sequence-diagram.png" alt="Content Sync Sequence Diagram" /></p>

<p>Once the download sync is complete, the app sends an Intent notifying the Main homescreen application about the content update so that it can display a friendly message to the user in case the device content is being used/played at that time. The main app stores some of the data in memory or in a SQLite database when it starts, so in order to cleanly rebuild that entire data structure we&rsquo;re currently rebooting the device. But in future <em>we&rsquo;re planning to avoid it, so that the content update does not need a reboot</em>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project has helped us gain a lot of valuable knowledge and insight into the Android platform and development practices as a whole. It has been a tremendous learning exercise for all of us. Even though the project is nearing completion, there are still some cases where we can optimize a bit, for example if you have gone through the above diagrams then you may have realized that the flows can be simplified even further by introducing <strong>Android Push Messaging (C2DM)</strong>, this we&rsquo;ll do sometime in later months, and as we already have the provisioning server in place then it&rsquo;s just a matter of time that we develop the feaures and push it to the wild.</p>

<p>On a closing note, if you want to build an app like this, then you can get in touch with us at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#x62;&#x69;&#x7a;&#x40;&#x71;&#x75;&#97;&#100;&#110;&#111;&#x64;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#x62;&#105;&#122;&#64;&#x71;&#x75;&#97;&#x64;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>, we&rsquo;d be happy to help you.</p>

    <link href="http://arnab.ch/blog/2011/12/phonegap-how-does-it-work/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-05T00:47:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2011/12/phonegap-how-does-it-work</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PhoneGap is an open-source cross-platform Mobile Application development framework by Nitobi Software (now Adobe) which allows web developers to build mobile apps using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>The PhoneGap project has been moved to Apache Incubator and now it is known as &ldquo;Apache Callback&rdquo;. PhoneGap project is divided into several sub-projects where each one represents a separate platform. In order to develop for iPhone and iPad, you need Mac OSX and XCode installed, similarly for Android you need Google Android SDK, Eclipse ADT Plugin, Ant as well as Eclipse IDE.</p>

<p>The official project detail can be found here <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" title="Apache Cordova/PhoneGap">Apache Cordova</a>. <del>It is currently hosted in GitHub and once the Apache infrastructure is ready it will be moved there.</del></p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>

<p>PhoneGap supports several mobile platforms, which enables web developers to write code using their existing HTML/JS skills and deploy to multiple platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS (iPhone/iPad)</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Symbian</li>
<li>BlackBerry</li>
<li>WebOS (most likely dead &ndash; go blame HP)</li>
<li>WP7</li>
<li>Samsung Bada</li>
</ul>


<p>The environment setup for each of the above mentioned platforms can be found in <a href="http://phonegap.com/start/" title="Getting Started with PhoneGap">&ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>PhoneGap is not a &ldquo;native application development&rdquo; framework, even though it provides access through several device features using an abstraction layer, which otherwise are inaccessible to a normal webpage. In simple words, it provies a &ldquo;WebView&rdquo; with extended capabilities. Using PhoneGap one can access the following device features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Geolocation</li>
<li>Compass</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Media</li>
<li>Accelerometer</li>
<li>Network</li>
<li>Notification</li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Filesystem</li>
<li>etc&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>The following diagram explains how does a PhoneGap architecture look like:</p>

<p><img src="http://arnab.ch/images/phonegap-architecture.jpg" alt="PhoneGap Architecture" /></p>

<p>In the above dialogram we can see that PhoneGap provides a &ldquo;WebView&rdquo; which is nothing but a bare bone web browser without a Chrome UI. The native code in PhoneGap SDK exposes uniform APIs across multiple device platforms which are accessible to JavaScript running inside the WebView.</p>

<p>As a web developer if you are using PhoneGap then it&rsquo;s less likely that you&rsquo;ll need to know the internals of the SDK (although it is always recommended to go through the source code in case you want to enlighten yourself as well as get fascinated by the tremendous efforts that the PhoneGap developers have put into it)</p>

<h2>How to approach PhoneGap development</h2>

<p>Even though you&rsquo;re using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to develop applications, remember that it&rsquo;s not a traditional desktop browser environment and the user experience pattern is significantly different. The PhoneGap apps are downloadable from App Store, so user might not know(or they don&rsquo;t even care) that your app is built using PhoneGap or HTML/CSS, it&rsquo;s always a good practice to be consistent with the platform UI guidelines so that you don&rsquo;t confuse your users. A simple example could be if you&rsquo;re developing a PhoneGap app for Android then be sure to handle the hardware/software(ICS) &ldquo;back key&rdquo;, if you don&rsquo;t do that then your users might get confused.</p>

<p>Another important factor is handling scaling and device orientation, you should always make sure that your app looks proper in both Portrait and Landscape orientations.</p>

<p>The recommended way to start PhoneGap development is below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup environment for the target platform for example iOS/Android etc, see <a href="http://phonegap.com/start/">Getting Started</a>.</li>
<li>Run the sample app provided with the PhoneGap SDK.</li>
<li>Go though the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/" title="PhoneGap API Documentation">API Documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Try creating sample apps of your own using each of the device features available through the PhoneGap API.</li>
<li>Once you are familiar with PhoneGap, try creating a sample app which uses multiple device APIs, you can try using jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Jo HTML5 Mobile App or jQTouch) to build the Phone like user interface.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>PhoneGap as development platform is very attractive and promises to bring uniformity across several mobile platforms. It aims to become a de facto mobile application development framework using HTML5 based technologies. But as said above the capabilities offered by the framework is limited to what a &ldquo;WebView&rdquo; can do. The following are a list of things to watch out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>In iOS the WebView is not JIT enabled (however the actual iPhone browser is), which means the JS code can&rsquo;t take advantage of the engine optimizations which are otherwise available to actual browser of the device.</li>
<li>In Android the CSS rendering in WebView is not as par with iOS, the rounded corners often look jagged.</li>
<li>The WebView runs with limited amount of memory, be sure to optimize your JS code so that it doesn&rsquo;t cause trouble.</li>
<li>If you are developing for multiple platforms, make sure that you&rsquo;re aware of the capabilities available in that platform, for example &ndash; in latest iOS you can use WebSocket but in Android it&rsquo;s not yet available (not confirmed in ICS though).</li>
<li>PhoneGap has good support from BlackBerry 6.0+ (with WebWorks SDK), phones with older BlackBerry versions may not work as expected.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>

<p>As your app runs inside WebView (aka a browser), you should not allow untrusted third-party code to execute in the page, because this can compromize the security, the JS code downloaded from internet will suddenly have access to several device features that they can make substantial damage to user&rsquo;s privacy and security. Do not load an iFrame in your app, or redirect to some other websites when the app is loaded, as this will likely get your app rejected in Apple app store, beacuse Apple does not like applications opening public websites inside the app as it makes it difficult or almost impossible to enforce policies regarding content.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The following resouces can be useful for HTML5 based mobile apps development (not all are related to PhoneGap):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://joapp.com">Jo HTML5 App Framework</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch">Sencha Touch &ndash; Commercial</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jqtouch.com">jQTouch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://appmobi.com">AppMobi</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dhtmlx.com/touch/">DHTMLX Touch</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nimblekit.com/">NimbleKit &ndash; iOS only Commercial</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.the-m-project.org/">The M-Project</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.winktoolkit.org/">Wink Toolkit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://zeptojs.com">Zepto.js &ndash; JavaScript library for Webkit browsers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.JS &ndash; JavaScript MVC framework</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>PhoneGap provides an opportunity to a vast pool of web developers reusing their existing skills to develop applications for mobile phones, which in future is going to be one of the most important medium to access information and content in internet. As the phones become more powerful, the new capabilities will be available in your arsenal. The recent developments in HTML5 based technologies also usher a new change in this segment. Do not miss the bus and keep exploring PhoneGap.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA["new" Operator in JavaScript]]></title>
    <link href="http://arnab.ch/blog/2010/04/new-operator-in-javascript/"/>
    <updated>2010-04-20T09:10:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://arnab.ch/blog/2010/04/new-operator-in-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In JavaScript, there’s an operator called <code>new</code> which we use to create an instance of an object (i.e Constructor function). So, what does <strong>new</strong> do? Well, it ensures that you always get an object when you use it with a constructor function. By the way, there’s no difference between a constructor function and a normal function, both are same. The term constructor function is used to indicate that we can create an object of that type using the <strong>new</strong> operator.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="c1">// =&gt; Foo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above code pretty much says that you first create an instance of the constructor function (note the upper case first letter, it is a convention not a rule ) using <code>new</code> operator, once that statement executes you now have an object as the value of <code>foo</code> and in the next line it simply prints the “<em>name”</em> property of that object, which in this case is an instance variable of the constructor function &ldquo;Foo&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Take a look at the example below and guess what would be the value of <code>foo</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Foo&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="c1">// =&gt; Foo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Interesting thing is that in this case the value of <code>foo</code> is still an object, but we did return a String, so why the hell <code>foo</code> contains an object? Well, the purpose of the <strong>new</strong> keyword is to ensure that you always get an object, so anything other than object is discarded, if you return an object then that will be used else a new object is created and returned. Now if we replace our return statement using this code <code>return { prop: 'Foo' };</code> then the value of <code>foo</code> will have a different value altogether and accessing <code>foo.name</code> will result in <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if you return <code>null</code> then that will be NOT be used, even though you might think that <em>null</em> is an object and <code>typeof(null) === 'object'</code>, so it should use that. In fact, it does not, it appears that <strong>new</strong> returns only objects which can evaluate to truthy value.</p>

<p>The last but not the least, if you return a <strong>function</strong> other than object then the function will be used. Why? Because functions are objects too, only difference is that they are special objects, that’s why there’s a separation between objects and functions, the <code>typeof</code> operator handles that properly, but in this case it appears that the <strong>new</strong> doesn&rsquo;t really care about that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Frontend engineering as it stands today is a bit of vague and unspecified territory, it’s still not clearly understood may be because of the lack of clarity around stuffs a frontend engineer does. To simply put, frontend engineering means understanding the browsers best, the work of a frontend engineer is what you see when you do “view source”. So, how can you become a frontend engineer? In this post I’ll list down some of the things that a would be frontend engineer should know about. Frontend engineers write software using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and yes I meant ‘writing software’, because if you look at modern day web applications like Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Google Wave all are complex applications which involves significant amount of JavaScript, CSS, HTML and other technologies. So basically it means a frontend engineer should be specialized in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p> <!--more--></p>

<p>Below are the list of things that I would expect to see in a would be frontend engineer:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Semantic and non-semantic markup</strong> &ndash; Understanding the differences between semantic and non-semantic HTML is a key area in web development, in HTML we have different tags with different semantic meaning, a frontend engineer should know which tag to use when, it’s not a good practice to use &lt;DIV&gt; tag to display paragraphs even if both &lt;P&gt; and &lt;DIV&gt; visually look similar.</li>
<li><strong>Rendering modes</strong> – Every browser for the sake of backward compatibility has implemented two types of rendering modes, and browser’s use DOCTYPE tag as the rendering mode switcher. It’s important to know about rendering modes because they drastically affect the way browsers render a webpage. Primarily, there are two rendering modes “Standards mode” and “Quirks mode”, some browsers even have “almost standards mode”. In “standards mode” browser will try to display a webpage in the most efficient way possible, where as in “quirks mode” browser will display the page in a backward compatible way.</li>
<li><strong>Structure, presentation and behavior</strong> – These are the key design elements in building websites. The structure (HTML), presentation/styling (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript) should be separated out, which helps make you page modular and maintainable. Remember it also speeds up your site, because the presentation and behavior layer will likely be cached by the browser, which results in faster downloads. Use meaningful markup with Class and Ids as the possible hook for adding styling and behavior. Never use inline event handlers in your HTML, instead use Unobtrusive JavaScript to attach event handlers, which helps keep the markup clean.</li>
<li><strong>Ability to hand code your HTML</strong> – There are some WYSIWYG editors out there in the market, but I would recommend not to use any one of them, instead learn to write HTML by hand coding, because this will give you the ability to create a visual picture of your page layout in your mind, if you continue this practice after some time you will notice that you can almost tell how many DIVs you need to create a particular layout just seeing that design. Remember that all those big web applications out there were created by hand coding HTML and CSS, once you are proficient writing HTML then you can use some code auto-completion utilities to speed things up a little bit.</li>
<li><strong>CSS and browser quirks</strong> – The CSS stands for ‘Cascading Style Sheets’, here ‘Cascading’ means a way to determine which CSS rules are going to apply on a particular element. So it’s important to know how <em>Specificity</em>, <em>Order</em>, <em>Inheritance</em> and above all the <em>Box Model</em> are being calculated. Some browsers have terribly wrong implementation of some CSS standards so it is important to have the knowledge regarding browser workarounds, there are CSS hacks and fixes available for some browsers most notably Internet Explorer, which you can use or you might consider using _conditional-comments a_s a way to include special style sheet for that depending on your needs. Another thing in this context is the knowledge regarding ‘<a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=hasLayout">hasLayout</a>’ concept in IE6/7, this concept is one of the main reasons behind CSS bugs in above mentioned browsers.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript Language</strong> – Learn this language, it’s no toy language anymore and it’s not even distantly related with Java excluding the naming similarity. It is an Object-oriented language with <em>prototypal inheritance</em> pattern. This is the language which drives modern day web applications, since the advent of Ajax this period has seen a tremendous growth of JavaScript. I believe that the way <strong>HTML5</strong> is heading this language is going to be one of the most important programming languages in the next decade. JavaScript was designed in a hurry, so there are some rough edges and some incorrect implementation, hence it’s important to know the good and bad parts of the language. In modern web applications JavaScript interacts heavily with DOM(Document Object Model), so having a good understanding of DOM methods, traversal techniques, DOM manipulation are necessary. I recommend picking up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Wrox-Programmer/dp/047022780X">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a>.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript and CSS Frameworks</strong> – Once you are well familiar with all the above concepts, it’s time to pick up few JavaScript and CSS frameworks. Nevertheless, the JavaScript Frameworks that you should check out are <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a> etc. and for CSS Frameworks there are <a href="http://wiki.github.com/stubbornella/oocss">OOCSS</a>, <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a> and <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> etc.. Even though you can go through with those libraries, I would recommend you should go through their source code whenever possible, this will give you a lot of insight into what’s happening and how those libraries have organized their code, you’ll learn a lot, I guarantee.</li>
<li><strong>Website Optimization</strong> – This is a very important point, and you just cannot ignore it&#160; anymore. Latency is one of the main reason behind slow websites, but you can do very little about it, so focus on areas where optimization can give you significant result. Learn how to cache your assets using proper HTTP headers, serve your assets using Gzip, optimize images (there are some good tools around one example is <a href="http://github.com/kristoferbaxter/SmallerMaker">SmallerMaker</a> ), know how browsers do parallel downloading, consider using ‘Lazy Loading’ techniques, load scripts on-demand/on the fly when required and use CSS sprites where suitable(although you can take a peek at <em><a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/11/16/cssembed-automatically-data-uri-ize/">Data URIs</a></em>).

<li><strong>Staying up-to-date</strong> – The frontend technologies are changing almost everyday, so it’s very necessary to stay up-to-date, you got to keep an eye on the stuffs happening around JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3 and other best practices, which will help you gather information and knowledge upfront, which you can later use in your work.</li>
<li><strong>Communication and co-ordination</strong> – Last but not the least, this is a very important job that a frontend engineer has to do everyday with his peers, managers and creative designers. He/she has to communicate well in terms of what can be possible in the browser, how changing something can improve or degrade accessibility or performance. I have seen designers often like to design interfaces by pouring every bit of their creativity and aesthetic sense, which is a good thing definitely, but in a real world implementing those interfaces using HTML/CSS is sometimes impossible, hence it is the frontend engineer who should actually communicate with the designers about what can be done and what can not. In some cases he/she often has to push back some features which might introduce too much complexity or impact the performance of the application as a whole, and while doing so I would expect that a good frontend engineer to come out with alternate solutions in a constructive way. As frontend engineers sit somewhere between middle-tier, creative and product management, so their efforts are directly related with these people, communicating and coordinating properly will definitely serve well.</li>
</ul>


<p>Well if you want to be a frontend engineer make sure that you know stuff I mentioned above, these are just the beginning by the way, there are a lot of things that you will learn eventually, but don’t forget to make sure that your base is strong, do a lot of practice, ask questions, read articles and blogs and finally think like a frontend engineer. All the best.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: The use of the word ‘engineer’ is not meant to do anything with ‘Engineering discipline’ at all, I know traditional engineers do a lot of hard work to achieve that academic qualification, as working in Frontend also involves similar amount of hard work that’s why the term has been used here to refer the collective effort of these hard-working people.</em></p>
