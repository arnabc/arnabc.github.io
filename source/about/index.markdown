I am an Android, JavaScript and Ruby developer living in India. I grew up near the hills of majestic Darjeeling and graduated from North Bengal University with a degree in English Literature. I currently work at **QuadNode Technologies** India which I co-founded in 2011.

I am a self-learner and learnt most of my programming skills by myself. Personally I value and admire quality code, clean user interface and beautiful typography. These days I mainly focus on DevOps, performance optimization and application security.

Last but not the least, as a technologist my aim is to build something useful which will have a positive impact on people's lives. I currently live in Pune, India with my beautiful wife Sarmistha.
